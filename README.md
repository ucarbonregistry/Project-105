The purpose of the project activity is to utilize renewable wind energy for generation of electricity. 
The project activity replaces anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG’s) into the atmosphere, 
which is estimated to be approximately 104,068 tCO2e annually, by displacing the equivalent amount of 
electricity generation through the operation of existing fuel mix in the grid comprising mainly fossil fuel-based power plants and future capacity expansions connected to the grid.

The Project involves 75-wind energy converters (WECs) of 800 kW E-48 with internal
electrical lines connecting the Project with local evacuation facility. The WECs generates
3-phase power at 400V, which is stepped up to 33 KV. The Project can operate in the
frequency range of 47.5–51.5 Hz and in the voltage range of 400 V ± 12.5%

PRIOR HISTORY: 
______________
UNFCCC CDM Project 1168 : Enercon Wind Farm (Hindustan) Ltd in Rajasthan
The project activity was registered under Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project with
registration number 1168, as well as Gold Standard (GS) with reference number 2483. The crediting
period of this project under CDM & GS is 15/03/2010 to 14/03/2020. PP seeks verification under
UCR from 15/03/2020 onwards, i.e., crediting period for UCR starts from 15/03/2020. Hence, there
is no double counting.
