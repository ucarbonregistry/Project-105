Enercon Wind Farm (Hindustan) Ltd in Rajasthan
The purpose of the project activity is to utilize renewable wind energy for generation of electricity. 
The project activity replaces anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGâ€™s) into the atmosphere, 
which is estimated to be approximately 104,068 tCO2e annually, by displacing the equivalent amount of 
electricity generation through the operation of existing fuel mix in the grid comprising mainly fossil fuel-based power plants and future capacity expansions connected to the grid.
